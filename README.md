## Choosing class which will encapsulate others and first fire action

In the context of deleting a document from Elasticsearch, the responsibility typically falls within the domain of the ElasticsearchDocument class.

Here's why:

Responsibility Alignment: The ElasticsearchDocument class represents a specific document within Elasticsearch. It encapsulates the document's data and provides operations related to that document, such as updating, retrieving, and deleting.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): According to the SRP, each class should have a single responsibility. The responsibility of the ElasticsearchDocument class is to manage operations specific to a document, including deletion.

High Cohesion: The ElasticsearchDocument class should have high cohesion, meaning that it should encapsulate related behaviors and data. Deleting a document is a core operation related to managing a document's lifecycle, and it makes sense for this functionality to be encapsulated within the ElasticsearchDocument class.
